# Use of page object model for easy test maintenance (webelement locators stored in seperate files, therefore many keywords can refer to a single locator)
# PageObjects folder contains the web element locators
# - Test Cases folder for high level gherkin style test / bdd statements
# - Resources folder for robot keywords
# - Results folder for output report viewable in any browser
